#Overview
This project investigates how self-awareness emerges from the physical and informational organization of living systems. 
It begins from the premise that consciousness is matter’s capacity to process information, while awareness is the 
system’s recursive modeling of itself.
I hypothesize that self-awareness arises near a critical point between order and chaos, where information flow, memory, 
and stability are co-optimized. Anesthesia provides a natural testbed: awareness fades as the brain departs from this 
critical balance and returns as it is restored.
Through computational modeling and multimodal data analysis, this project aims to identify quantitative markers of 
transitions between awareness and unawareness—reframing consciousness as a phenomenon of self-organized critical 
homeostasis that links molecular biology, neuroscience, and quantum information.

##Project steps
A multi-stage investigation combining:
1. Data Analysis: Statistical and information-theoretic characterization of EEG/fMRI data during anesthesia.
2. Simulation: Network-based and dynamical-systems modeling of brain criticality (e.g., coupled oscillators, Ising or 
neural field models).
3. Machine Learning: Classification and prediction of awareness states using entropy, mutual information, and criticality
metrics.
4. Quantum/Information Integration: Exploratory modeling of integrated information and coherence using Integrated 
Information Theory (IIT) and quantum-inspired frameworks.

C. Criticality test 

Power-law fits of avalanche size and duration with Clauset method and cpmpare exponents to theoretical near-critical 
values and test goodness of fit versus log-normal.

Branching ratio m: estimate from avalanche trees or point processes. Near 1 indicates criticality.

Critical slowing down: rising variance and lag-1 autocorrelation when approaching loss or recovery of responsiveness. 
Track over time to mark transitions.

DFA on amplitude envelopes and principal components. Values near 0.5 are uncorrelated, higher values indicate long-range
dependence.
Aperiodic exponent from FOOOF as a proxy for excitation-inhibition balance changes


D. State Model 

Create a feature vector per epoch or per scan: [spectral, aperiodic, entropy, LZC, DFA, autocorr, avalanche, FC graph 
metrics]

Fit an HMM or Bayesian state-space model with 5 latent states. Initialize with k-means centroids for stability.

Constrain interpretation by anchoring one state to burst suppression epochs and one to fully awake epochs. The others 
are learned.
Output a state trajectory over time and state centroids that define the five levels.

E. Evalaution 

Internal: silhouette on state clusters, temporal dwell times, transition probabilities that match clinical phases.

External: accuracy vs. behavioral responsiveness if available. Cross-dataset replication on a second EEG or fMRI set.

Interpretability: SHAP or permutation importance on features that define each state.

Step 3. Modeling, simulation, ML

Simulate critical transitions with Kuramoto or Wilson–Cowan networks and fit to observed features.

Train classifiers to predict the five states from features.

Step 4 IIT integration

Compute toy Φ on reduced networks and relate to state index. Include as a feature.

Step 5. Quantum extensions

CV-friendly encodings for spectral features.

QML hybrid kernels as a baseline alongside classical kernels.

Long-term: toy simulation of drug mechanism effects on network parameters.
