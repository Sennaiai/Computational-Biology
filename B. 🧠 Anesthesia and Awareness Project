#Overview
This project investigates how self-awareness emerges from the physical and informational organization of living systems. 
It begins from the premise that consciousness is matter’s capacity to process information, while awareness is the 
system’s recursive modeling of itself.
I hypothesize that self-awareness arises near a critical point between order and chaos, where information flow, memory, 
and stability are co-optimized. Anesthesia provides a natural testbed: awareness fades as the brain departs from this 
critical balance and returns as it is restored.
Through computational modeling and multimodal data analysis, this project aims to identify quantitative markers of 
transitions between awareness and unawareness—reframing consciousness as a phenomenon of self-organized critical 
homeostasis that links molecular biology, neuroscience, and quantum information.

#Project steps
A multi-stage investigation combining:
1. Data Analysis: Statistical and information-theoretic characterization of EEG/fMRI data during anesthesia.
2. Simulation: Network-based and dynamical-systems modeling of brain criticality (e.g., coupled oscillators, Ising or 
neural field models).
3. Machine Learning: Classification and prediction of awareness states using entropy, mutual information, and criticality
metrics.
4. Quantum/Information Integration: Exploratory modeling of integrated information and coherence using Integrated 
Information Theory (IIT) and quantum-inspired frameworks.

#Methods (Proposed)
Power-law analysis, entropy, and mutual information measures
Dynamical network modeling and criticality simulations
Unsupervised and supervised ML (e.g., clustering, logistic regression, neural networks)
Python tools: NumPy, SciPy, PyTorch, NetworkX, Qiskit, PennyLane
IIT modeling (via pyPhi or custom implementation)


#Data Sources
EEG/MEG Anesthesia Datasets – PhysioNet
OpenNeuro fMRI Datasets
Literature-based clinical datasets (for comparative validation)


#Future Directions
a. Extend analysis to memory and information integration dynamics under anesthesia and recovery.
b. Build quantum-adaptive simulation models to explore coherence and decoherence in neural information flow.
