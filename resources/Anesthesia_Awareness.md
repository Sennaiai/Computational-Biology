# Anesthesia & Awareness Modeling

## Overview

This project develops a computational framework to study how brain states transition between unconsciousness and awareness using quantitative systems modeling.

The central idea is that awareness emerges from large-scale neural dynamics operating near critical regimes of information flow and stability. Anesthesia provides a controlled setting to study how biological networks move between ordered, disordered, and functional states.

This work treats consciousness not as a philosophical abstraction, but as a measurable dynamical phenomenon in complex biological systems.

## Objective

To model and quantify transitions between brain states using a unified pipeline combining:

* Dynamical systems modeling of neural networks
* Statistical and information-theoretic analysis of neural signals
* Machine learning for state classification and prediction

The long-term aim is to build biologically grounded, computationally rigorous models of cognitive state transitions with translational relevance to neuroscience and medicine.

## Project Scope

The project integrates:

* Multimodal neural data analysis (EEG, fMRI)
* Network and criticality-based brain modeling
* Machine learning–driven state inference
* Exploratory quantum-inspired computational extensions

This repository documents the computational architecture behind a larger research program focused on quantitative modeling of biological intelligence.

## Status

Active research framework under development.
Detailed technical design and modeling roadmap maintained privately to guide implementation.
