CRISPR-Cas9 in T Cells — Probabilistic Molecular Editing Model
This project develops a quantitative modeling framework for CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in T cells, treating gene editing as a molecular-scale dynamical process governed by binding energetics, sequence context, chromatin state, and stochastic repair mechanisms.
The pipeline integrates biophysical priors with machine-learning models to estimate on- and off-target cleavage probabilities, predict repair outcome distributions, and aggregate these into practical scenario-level editing probabilities. In this sense, CRISPR is modeled analogously to an enzyme–substrate system, where sequence recognition, binding stability, and reaction pathways jointly determine macroscopic outcomes.
By combining sequence features, epigenetic context, and probabilistic simulation, the project provides an end-to-end framework for molecular-level modeling of genome engineering decisions, with standardized outputs designed for downstream systems-level simulations.
The objective is to bridge molecular biophysics, statistical learning, and dynamical systems modeling into a unified computational framework for high-resolution biological intervention modeling.
