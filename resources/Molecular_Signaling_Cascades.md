# CAR-T Cell Signaling Cascade — Systems-Level Dynamics Model

This project develops a mechanistic and computational model of CAR-T cell activation as a **multi-scale dynamical system**, linking intracellular signaling kinetics to population-level therapeutic outcomes.

The framework simulates how dual-target CAR-T cells integrate antigen binding into downstream signaling cascades that govern proliferation, cytotoxicity, persistence, and cytokine release. Rather than treating therapy response as a black box, the project models the underlying biochemical network driving efficacy and toxicity.

Ordinary differential equation models and stochastic simulations are combined with data-driven overlays to quantify trade-offs between tumor clearance and adverse immune activation. Molecular-level perturbations from upstream T-cell engineering are propagated through the signaling network to study their systems-level consequences.

The objective is to build a unified computational model of immune-cell decision making, connecting molecular signaling dynamics to emergent therapeutic behavior in a rigorously quantitative framework.
