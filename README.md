## Overview

This repository contains my computational biology portfolio, focused on quantitative modeling of biological systems in a translational and drug-discovery context.

My work integrates computational methods with a strong foundation in molecular and cellular biology, treating biological processes as dynamical systems that can be modeled, simulated, and optimized.

---

## Focus

The central aim of this work is:

**To model biological processes as quantitative systems governed by molecular interactions and physical constraints.**

Across applications, the methodology is consistent:

* Machine learning for biological data modeling
* Optimization for biological network inference
* Simulation for molecular and cellular dynamics

These approaches are developed using classical, quantum-inspired, and hybrid quantum–classical frameworks grounded in statistical physics and quantum mechanics.
