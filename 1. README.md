Bridging a foundation in Molecular and Cellular Biology with computational methodologies, I explore the intersection of experimental research and computational modeling. My work focuses on developing practical projects that strengthen expertise in AI/ML, biological computation, and molecular simulation, with applications across molecular genetics, systems biology, and neurobiology. By integrating wet-lab insights with data-driven and algorithmic approaches, I aim to position computational biology as a cornerstone of my research. In parallel, I am exploring the integration of quantum computing and emerging technologies to design adaptable frameworks for future quantum-enhanced computation—enabling more accurate, holistic, and powerful models of biological systems beyond the NISQ era.
