Bridging my background in Molecular and Cellular Biology with computational methodologies, and exploring the intersection of experimental research and computational modeling. My focus is on developing practical projects that strengthen skills in AI/ML, biological computation, and molecular simulation, with applications spanning molecular genetics, systems biology, and neurobiology. By combining wet-lab insight with data-driven and algorithmic approaches, I aim to harness the growing role of computational biology as a cornerstone in my research. In parallel, I aim integrate quantum computing and emerging technologies to design frameworks adaptable to future quantum-enhanced computation, enabling more accurate, holistic, and powerful models of biological systems beyond the NISQ era.
