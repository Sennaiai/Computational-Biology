Bridging my background in Molecular and Cellular Biology with computational methodologies, this repository explores the intersection of wet-lab science and 
computational modeling. The goal is to develop hands-on projects that strengthen skills in AI/ML, biological computation, and molecular simulations â€” with 
applications across Molecular Genetics, Systems Biology, and Neurobiology.
By combining wet-lab and dry-lab approaches, and leveraging the rapid progress of computational and AI-driven research, this repository aims to contribute to 
the emerging maturity and impact of computational biology as a core pillar of modern science.
In parallel, by integrating quantum computing and technology skills, each project is designed with quantum system adaptability in mind. As quantum hardware 
evolves beyond the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, these methods may enable more accurate, holistic, and powerful models â€” advancing the full 
adoption of quantum-enhanced computation in scientific research.
